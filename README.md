# noise-maps

## Running the project locally

If you want to run the project locally, you can do so by following these steps:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

The URLs for the canisters will be printed to the console after running `dfx deploy`. Click on the `noise-maps-frontend` to view the app.
